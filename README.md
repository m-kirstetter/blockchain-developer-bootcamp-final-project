## Final project idea

Description: A freelance smart contract development dApp marketplace where recruiters can post smart contract development (or audit, etc) gigs and contractor apply to, and get paid for work.
Recruiter would see full historical work from applicant's wallet address.
To save gas, only gig hash would be stored on Ethereum blockchain.
Gig amount is locked in smart contract and need to be released by gig owner or admin.

App will have 2 roles:

- Recruiter - can: create edit and delete gigs, accept freelancer, accept work (with review) to release funds
- Freelancer - can: browse, apply to gigs (contract interaction) and get paid after work is accepted by recruiter
